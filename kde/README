To Build (tested on Arch Linux):

~> cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
~> make

The bcompare_ext_kde5.so is found in ./
It can be copied manually to /usr/lib/qt/plugins/kf5/kfileitemaction/

The .desktop file must not be copied, this is a source file in order to generate a JSON file.

To install directly on the system:
~> sudo make install

To "install" in a fakeroot in order to create a package:
~> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install
