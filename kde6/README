To Build (tested on Arch Linux):

~> cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
~> make

Generated bcompare_ext_kde6.so is found in bin/kf6/kfileitemaction/
It can be copied manually to /usr/lib/qt6/plugins/kf6/kfileitemaction/bcompare_ext_kde6.so

To install directly on the system:
~> sudo make install

To "install" in a fakeroot in order to create a package:
~> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install
